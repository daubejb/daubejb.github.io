## My Notes:

### Chapter 1 - Getting Started

1. **No notes**
---

### Chapter 2 - Your First Program

1. Two types of Go programs:  executables and libraries
  - executable applications are the kinds of programs that we can run directly from terminal
  - libraries are collections of code that we package together so that we can use them in other programs
2. Go mostly does not care about whitespace
3. **fmt** the Go package that implements formatting for input and output
4. **Double quotes** - is a string literal, which is a type of "expression"
5. // represents the beginning of a comment, ///* asdfasfasdfasdf /*/ can be used for a multi line comment
