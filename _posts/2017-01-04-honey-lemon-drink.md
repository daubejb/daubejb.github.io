# Daily Lemon Honey Drink

## Introduction

I am a fan of ritual.  Intrigued by the health benefits of honey and citrus, below is my recipe for an
morningtime lemon honey drink

## Recipe

### Ingredients

- Lemon (1/2 of fruit)
- Honey (1 1/2 teaspoons)
- Water (8 ounces)

### Equipment

- Pint glass (16 ounce, clear)
- Teaspoon
- Citrus press (optional)

### Directions

1. **Juice** 1/2 of a *lemon* into the *pint glass*
2. **Add** 1 1/2 teaspoon *honey* to the *lemon juice*
3. **Fill** the *pint glass* approximately half full with *water*
4. **Stir** vigourously with the *teaspoon* until thoroughly combined
5. **Enjoy**

### Observations

1.  Adding the *lemon juice* prior to the *honey* prevents the *honey* from
sticking to the *pint glass* + expedites mixture time
2. **Increase** or **Decrease** the amount of *water* to adjust drink potency
3. **Use** a clear *pint glass* to see when mixture has occurred

### Lemon health benefits

1. High in Potassium (~ 80 milligrams) : needed to maintain body fluid balance,
muscle function, and basic cell function
2. High in Vitamin C (cancer-fighting antioxidant) : needed to repair and
maintain cartilage, bones, and teeth 

### Honey health benefits

1. High in antioxidants : vitamin E, flavonoids, phenolics, + vitamin C
2. Natural anti-bacterial and anti-fungal
3. Reduces throat irritation
