16. Why is marketing important for an expert in business process analysis? one of the most important business process types is the value chain.
17. Marketing - is the market-oriented realization of enterprise goals and the alignment of the entire enterprise in the market
18. Marketing - is a process in the economic and social structure which individuals and groups use to meet their requirements and request by generating, offering, and exchanging proudcts and other things of value
19. Two types of marketing (proactive and reactive)
20. Main process elements of marketing:
  - market segmentation
  - strategy development
  - market research
  - pricing
  - placement
  - value chain
21. Value chain - every enterprise is a collection of activities that are performed to design, produce, market, deliver, and support its product.  All these activities can be represented in a value chain:
  - primary activities
    - inbound logistics
    - operations
    - outbound logistics
    - marketing and sales
    - services
  - supporting activities
    - firm infrastructure
    - human resources management

22. Project - is an undertaking with limited timeframes and budget to deliver several clearly defined results and is basically characterized by the uniqueness of conditions in their entirety (limited and unique)
23. Project management - application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques on a set of activities to meet a specified objective:
  - Initiation (charter, scope)
  - Planning (plan, estimate effort duration and costs, plan resources, analyze risks)
  - Executing (form a team, manage project execution, perform qa, inform)
  - Controlling ( monitor risks, report progress, initiate measures)
  - Closing (secure experiences, close contracts)
24. Fixed costs - are costs that are constant within a specific period of time and are independent of the production volume or quantity of sales
25.  Variable costs - are costs that vary if the production volume or quantity of sales changes
26.  Overhead costs - are costs that can be allocated only indirectly to a cost unit (prouduct, service)

  - break-even point = Fixed costs / Sales price - Variable costs per unit
30. Where the break-even analysis enables the assessment of different scenarios with regard to sales revenues and expenses, the crossover analysis uses the same principle to compare different scenarios with regard to fixed and variable costs.
  - low fixed costs, high variable costs, versus
  - high fixed costs, low variable costs
31. Decision tree - each fork is connected with probabilities of occurence
32. Scheduling and resouce planning - enables you to estimate whether projects can be completed within the timeframe required and whether the required resources are actually available
33. Network plan - split a project into tasks, put tasks into sequence, earliest start time, minimum run time, earliest and latest stop time. - helps establish critical path
